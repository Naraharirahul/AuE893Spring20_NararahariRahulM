For the circle.py file, I have chosen velocity to be 10. The turtlesim will continue to rotate for a distance of 100.
The angular velocity in z direction is given as v/r where v is the linear velocity and r is the radius of of the path.

The linear x velocity is always fixed which is 10. 

By using the move.py file and giving the angular velocity, the turtlesim will rotate to the input radius until Cntrl^C is applied.  


For square_openloop.py file, I have combined both move.py and rotate.py code to make the turtlesim move around a score. 

For the turtlesim to move in x direction, first a velocity is given in x direction until it reaches the length of the side of the square. 
Then the turtlesim rotates 90 degrees, and a for loop iterates the same above procedure unitl it reaches the next distace 2.
